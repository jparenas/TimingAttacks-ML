# Determining Encryption Algorithms from Timing Data

Independent study at DePauw University

## Inspiration

It has been found in previous research that there is significant difference
between popular encryption algorithms in various aspects of performance. One of
these factors is processing time, which not only depends on the algorithm, but
also the size of the data to be encrypt and decrypt.

In this work, we implement a systematic approach to analyze the differences in
processing time between these algorithms, using various statistical tools. We
will also leverage modern machine learning models to automate the process of
identifying these systematic differences between the algorithms, to see whether
trained machine learning models can recognize particular algorithms from just
timing data.

If this type of [timing attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack)
can be achieved, we will further look to adjust these encryption algorithms so
sensitive timing data can be hidden from malicious users. 

## Tools

- Python 3 will be our main programming language for the project.
- We will use the `pycrypto` module to simulate different encryption algorithms.
